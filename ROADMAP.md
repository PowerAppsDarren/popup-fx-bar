## 📝 Technical Debt Items

- React Fiber dependency (fragile, version-specific)
- Global variable usage (`window.fxModel`)
- No configuration system
- No automated testing
- Monolithic IIFE structure

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **TODAY**: Apply Phase 1 security fixes
2. **THIS WEEK**: Complete Phase 2 optimizations
3. **NEXT WEEK**: Begin Phase 3 refactoring

## 📊 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| PowerApps updates break React traversal | HIGH | MEDIUM | Add version detection, multiple search strategies |
| XSS vulnerability exploited | CRITICAL | LOW | Immediate fix in Phase 1 |
| Memory leaks in long sessions | MEDIUM | HIGH | Timeout protection, proper cleanup |
| Popup blockers prevent usage | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Inline editor fallback |

---

## 👥 Stakeholders

- **Users**: PowerApps developers needing better formula editing
- **Security Team**: Must approve XSS fixes
- **PowerApps Team**: May break with platform updates
- **Community**: Potential open-source contributors
