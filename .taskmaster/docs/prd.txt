# PowerApps Popup Formula Bar - Refactoring & Security Fix PRD

## Project Overview
Refactor the PowerApps Popup Formula Bar to address critical security vulnerabilities, improve code quality, and implement a modular architecture as documented in the comprehensive code review.

## Current State
- Single monolithic JavaScript file with 144 lines
- Critical XSS vulnerability using document.write()
- No error handling or null checks
- Memory leaks and performance issues
- No build process or testing framework

## Goals
1. Fix critical security vulnerability (XSS)
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Modularize code into maintainable components
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Improve performance and memory management

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Stability Fixes (IMMEDIATE)
- Replace document.write() with secure DOM manipulation
- Add null/undefined checks for all property accesses
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fix memory leaks in cleanup handlers

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Performance
- Add input debouncing (300ms) to prevent excessive updates
- Implement proper event listener cleanup
- Add browser compatibility checks
- Create configuration system for debug logging

### Phase 3: Modular Architecture
- Split code into three modules:
  - finder.js: React Fiber traversal and Monaco editor discovery
  - sync.js: Bidirectional synchronization logic
  - ui.js: Popup window creation and management
- Implement module loader and dependency management
- Create main entry point that orchestrates modules

### Phase 4: Testing & Build Process
- Set up Jest testing framework
- Create unit tests for each module (80% coverage target)
- Add integration tests for popup synchronization
- Implement build process with webpack/rollup
- Add linting with ESLint

### Phase 5: Enhancement & Distribution
- TypeScript migration for type safety
- Create browser extension manifest
- Add configuration UI for settings
- Implement keyboard shortcuts
- Create user documentation

## Technical Specifications

### Security Requirements
- No use of document.write() or innerHTML with unsanitized content
- Content Security Policy headers in popup window
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Sanitize any user-provided content

### Performance Requirements
- Debounce input events (300ms)
- Limit React Fiber traversal depth (max 20)
- Clean up all event listeners on popup close
- Prevent memory leaks with proper disposal

### Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Primary
- Firefox - Secondary
- Safari - Nice to have

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint configuration following Airbnb style guide
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Error messages must be user-friendly
- All functions must have error handling

## Success Metrics
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- No memory leaks detectable in DevTools
- 80% test coverage
- Sub-100ms response time for text updates
- Zero console errors in normal usage

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with current PowerApps versions
- Cannot modify PowerApps application code
- Must work as bookmarklet or browser extension
- File size under 100KB minified

## Dependencies
- No external runtime dependencies for core functionality
- Development dependencies:
  - Jest for testing
  - Webpack/Rollup for bundling
  - ESLint for linting
  - TypeScript (Phase 5)

## Deliverables
1. Secure, refactored codebase
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. Build and deployment scripts
4. User documentation
5. Developer documentation

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Immediate (Today)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 4-5 weeks for complete refactoring
